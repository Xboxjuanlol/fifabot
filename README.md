FIFA coin Trading bot

About: This program currently uses the "lazy 1000" trading method. As in, players with enough coins get lazy and buy discard players for
1000 coins. The bot bids on those players for 650 coins and then lists them for 1000, in hopes of selling them to a "lazy" player.

Instructions: 
1. Own FIFA 20 and Ultimate Team
2. Have roughly 10,000 coins and an empty transfer list
3. Make sure you have pyautogui installed on your machine (pip install PyAutoGUI) in CMD
4. Log into the Web App https://www.easports.com/fifa/ultimate-team/web-app/
5. Run the program!

This program is unfinished and should expect many bugs. Works best on Opera Gaming browser
